  Output: Welcome to Cats Teach Stats!

- Class: text
  Output: Cats are the purrfect teachers for all students.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Do you like to watch cat videos?
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No;Maybe
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Yes')
  Hint: You should choose Yes

- Class: text
  Output: This lesson is taught by William Plumer Jacobs, catistician.

- Class: text
  Output: Hi. I am going to teach you to record a small data set and bring it into R.

- Class: text
  Output: First you need to collect some data.

- Class: video
  Output: Go to this online video of me, and count the number of times I use my left vs. right paw to boop the ball around the track.

- Class: text
  Output: Got your counts of left and right paw usage? If not, go watch the video again.
  

- Class: text
  Output: You will store your left paw count and right paw count into two separate variables.

- Class: text
  Output: There are two components to a variable.

- Class: text
  Output: The name of the variable is one part.

- Class: text
  Output: The information that we want to store is the second part.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's pretend that I used my left paw twice. Make a variable of this left paw count by typing left <- 2
  CorrectAnswer: left <- 2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='left <- 2')
  Hint: try typing left <- 2

- Class: text
  Output: So what you just did was make a variable called "left," which stores the number 2. 


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: OK, now let's store your real data into variables! First, remake the left variable with the left paw count you made from the video.
  CorrectAnswer: left <- 24
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='left <- 24')
  Hint: check your count - you should have found 24 left-paw boops

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can check to see what R thinks is stored in your variable by typing left
  CorrectAnswer: left
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='left')
  Hint: type "left" (no quotes)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, make a new right variable with your right paw count.
  CorrectAnswer: right <- 21
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='right <- 21')
  Hint: check your count - you should have found 21 right-paw boops. right <- 21

- Class: text
  Output: Variables can be many kinds of things. We can make a variable that stores left and right paw counts in that order.

- Class: text
  Output: This kind of variable, when multiple things are stored in it, is called a vector.

- Class: text
  Output: We'll make a vector with the c() function. The c stands for "concatenate" or "combine". For example, c(2, 4) makes a vector that has two numbers in it.



- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Try making a vector of the left and right variables you made in earlier steps. Use the c() function that you just learned. You know you did it right if you get 24 21
  CorrectAnswer: c(left, right)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='c(left, right)'')
  Hint: go to the help file by typing c?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now that you've made a vector of your data, store it in a new variable called boops.
  CorrectAnswer: boops <- c(left, right)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='boops <- c(left, right)')
  Hint: boops should be on the left side of the <- symbol, and c(left, right) comes next

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Check to see what R thinks is stored in your boops variable.
  CorrectAnswer: boops
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='boops')
  Hint: Just type "boops" (no quotes).
  
  

- Class: video
  Output: We have now recorded some data and communicated the data to R for later use. Let's wrap up by finding out what kind of data we have. Go watch this video on types of data.
  VideoLink: https://365datascience.com/explainer-video/types-data/

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the best data classification for the number of boops?
  AnswerChoices: numerical and discrete;categorical and continuous;numerical and continuous
  CorrectAnswer: numerical and discrete
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='numerical and discrete')
  Hint: There is no such thing as half a boop.

- Class: text
  Output: You have reached the end of this lesson on recording and entering a simple data set. Congratulations!
