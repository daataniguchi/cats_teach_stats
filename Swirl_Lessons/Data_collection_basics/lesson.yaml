  Hint: You should choose Yes

- Class: text
  Output: This lesson is taught by William Plumer Jacobs, catistician.

- Class: text
  Output: Hi. I am going to teach you to record a small data set and bring it into R.

- Class: text
  Output: First you need to collect some data.


- Class: video
  Output: Go to this online video of me, and count the number of times I use my left vs. right paw to boop the ball around the track. Type "Yes" to go to this online video.
  VideoLink: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW9Lmh3D4cY&feature=youtu.be

- Class: text
  Output: Got your counts of left and right paw usage? If not, go watch the video again.

- Class: text
  Output: To record our data set into R, we create variables. What is a variable? First, think about a computer program like a story. A variable is like the character in a story. and has a name and attributes.

- Class: text
  Output: Once you have created variables, you can make R do things with the variables, just like a writer makes characters do things in a story.

- Class: text
  Output: There are two components to a variable.

- Class: text
  Output: The name of the variable is one part.

- Class: text
  Output: The information that we want to store is the second part.

- Class: text
  Output: Just like in a story, where a character can be complex with lots of attributes, a variable can be used to store a lot of data. But here we are going to make variables that store small amounts of data.

- Class: text
  Output: We are going to make a variable called left, and another one called right to store your left paw count and right paw count, respectively.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's pretend that I used my left paw twice. Make a variable of this left paw count by typing left <- 2
  CorrectAnswer: left <- 2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='left <- 2')
  Hint: try typing left <- 2

- Class: text
  Output: So what you just did was make a variable called "left," which stores the number 2.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: OK, now let's store your real data into variables! Remake the left variable but use the real left paw count you made from the video.
  CorrectAnswer: left <- 24
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='left <- 24')
  Hint: check your count - you should have found 24 left-paw boops

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can check to see what R thinks is stored in your variable by typing left
  CorrectAnswer: left
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='left')
  Hint: type "left" (no quotes)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, make a new right variable with your right paw count.
  CorrectAnswer: right <- 21
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='right <- 21')
  Hint: check your count - you should have found 21 right-paw boops. right <- 21

- Class: text
  Output: Variables can be many kinds of things. We can make a variable that stores both left and right paw counts in that order.

- Class: text
  Output: This kind of variable, when multiple things are stored in it, is called a vector.

- Class: text
  Output: We'll make a vector with the c() function. The c stands for "concatenate" or "combine". For example, c(2, 4) makes a vector that has two numbers in it.
#do we want to capitalize the CAT in concatenate ? Or do I like puns too much?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Try making a vector of the left and right variables you made in earlier steps. Use the c() function that you just learned. You should see 24 21
  CorrectAnswer: c(left, right)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='c(left, right)')
  Hint: Did you type in the values of 24 and 21 instead of the names of the variables that store them? If that didn't help, go to the help file by typing c?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now you know how made a vector of your data! But we haven't actually made it into a variable, becase we haven't given it a name. Make a variable called boops, and store the vector c(left, right) into it.
  CorrectAnswer: boops <- c(left, right)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='boops <- c(left, right)')
  Hint: boops should be on the left side of the <- symbol, and c(left, right) comes next

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Check to see what R thinks is stored in your boops variable by typing its name.
  CorrectAnswer: boops
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='boops')
  Hint: Just type "boops" (no quotes).

- Class: video
  Output: We have now recorded some data and communicated the data to R for later use. Let's wrap up by finding out what kind of data we have. Type "Yes" to watch this video on types of data.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the best data classification for the number of boops?
  AnswerChoices: numerical and discrete;categorical and continuous;numerical and continuous
  CorrectAnswer: numerical and discrete
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='numerical and discrete')
  Hint: There is no such thing as half a boop.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the best data classification for the type of boop (left or right)?
  AnswerChoices: categorical;numerical;continuous
  CorrectAnswer: categorical
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='categorical')
  Hint: Types of boops can be divided into non-overlapping groups.

- Class: text
  Output: We can classify type of boop further.

- Class: text
  Output: When a categorical variable has only two possibilities (e.g., left and right), the data are binary.

- Class: text
  Output: We'll work with binary data again in the Binomial Test lesson, so stay tuned.

- Class: text
  Output: You have reached the end of this lesson on recording and entering a simple data set. Congratulations!
